Very recently I've heard two world class pundits discussing[^podcast] deepfakes and I was really surprised by their optimism about their impact and the hope in the techincal solution. One of the pundits, whom I admire, goes as far as to suggest that it may be a good thing - that deepfakes will and already are creating global skepticism about what we see. Skepticism is good, right?

My thesis is that proliferation of deepfakes is and it's an existentional threat to humanity.

In August 2019 Wikipedia uses the following definition of a deepfake.

>Deepfake (a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake") is a technique for human image synthesis based on artificial intelligencei. It is used to combine and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videos using a machine learning technique known as generative adversarial network. [^deepfake_wiki]

It actaully is not important if the fake material is made using a deep neural network. The important parts are that it appears to be unaltered representation of reality and for this post I will use the following definition:

> Deepfake is an image, video, audioclip, or other content that does not present real events but is distributed as if it was, and which to a human does not appear to be articially generated or altered.


As of 2019 GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are the tool of choice for creating Deepfakes.





I see three theses postulated in the few minutes of the interview that was dedicated to deepfakes.

# Fallacy 1. No trust = resilient individuals	

The claim here is that societies with no trust, with everpresent propaganda, and with an untrustworty public discourse in all forms, were, at least in some sense, good, because this develops some kind of intellectual resiliency and encourages research. 

I challange this view on multiple levels.
1. Numbers: Skepticsm to good propaganda is developed or present only in the fraction of the society. The majority just believes. See [advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising).
1. Resiliency: One cannot avoid being fooled all the time. Each of us believes in something that isn't true because we saw, heard, or read some meterial that wasn't true. 
1. Need: While skepticism is often seen as a good trait, it's a reaction to bad circumstances. I think the level of skepticism is a marker of how bad something is - skepticism is an antibody for the cancer of broken trust. On a coneptual level there is no need for sketpicsm. In my family I want trust, no skepticism towards my words. I want my children to trust me so much that it's dangerous for them if I lie. Home should feel safe and we should not see dangerous at every corner. 
1. Effects/consequences: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger mantra doesn't really makes sense, generally and in specific case of common distrust. 
   How often do you wish that you cannot trust your friends and family and that, from time to time, they break your trust? How often do you hear advice to tell someone a lie to make them resilient?  
   Let's consider two exapmles of consequences of broken trust:
     1. People who believe in conspiracy theories. 
        I don't think a person who doesn't trust anything or anybody is a great role model.
     1. Victims of deception. 
	People who were subject to deception can be affected for extended periods of time, it can cause serious mental issues.  
         
# Fallacy 2. Siver lining

> Deepfakes, in this sense, are creating global skepticism (...) it encourages further research[^lf-its-a-good-thing]

[^lf-its-a-good-thing]: Interview 40:45

This resoning is similar to point about the past, but applied to the future. 

Silver lining thinking, the attitude has been used to the political shifts of the recent years but there is plenty of historical evidence that things need to turn really sour before societies improve, if they do at all without external forces (the most obvious example for my generation is [WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II)). 

I believe that with deepfakes the damage done will be too deep and that there will be no external force to fix it. We're doomed.

The unfouned hopefuless of both pundits is most comical when it's expressed in the same breath as the need for skepticism. 

[//]: #This hopefulness by Lex, who is Jewish is really surprising. Remember Protocols of Zion or the posters of greedy Jews?

# Fallacy 3. Skepticism will save us

The claim here is that sketpicism is enough to deal with this. 

Firstly, I don't believe that there is that skepticsm will appear. Why would it? We needed more skepticism for claims that vaccines don't cause autism, or that there are no Elders of Zion. 

Secondly, again, it's not possible to be skeptical all the time about everything. How can one live, when everything nothing can be assumed real?


# Fallacy 4. Let's sign it

This claim is that we can sign the videos and that will allow verification.

How would this signing work when news is presented? We often interact with clips embedded in other clips. I cannot see how signing could work for this: how can you verify that the embedded clip is authentic? 

Also even if we only interact with full clips, it's impractical to certify everthing. 

The main counterargument is however that, it doesn't matter if we can technically verify if something is real. We just won't do it. There is a lot of infomration out there that is not true and can be easily verified and proved untrue. These lies are yet still believed. As Josha `TODO` points out we seek confirmations of our views rather than adjust our views in the face of the facts. 

# Broken trust vs. Bad Ideas and Filtering 

It's important to point out that broken trust is not the same as exposure. I’d argue that exposure is necessary for developing critical thinking. 
I agree 100% that with Roman Yampolskiy’s claim from his 2019 Singularity.fm interview [LINK] that  TODO 

We need more exposure, filtering is not a good solution (filtering as in internet filter bubbles, sheltered children, or removing bias from machine learning training data).

# The matchstick

My view is that deepfakes are the match that will ignite gaslighing on global scale.

> Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which a person seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, gaslighting involves attempts to destabilize the victim and delegitimize the victim's belief.[^gaslighting]

[^gaslighting]: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)

If you're still not sure at this stage I encourage you to do the following mental experiment. Imagine that you agree with your friends and people to lie to one another at random moments. You start lying about the weather, the time the dinner is. Nothing can be trusted anymore. How long before you literally go crazy? 


Deepfakes that are the most obviously dangerous are the ones distributed for the purpose of gaslighting. However, I believe that all deepfakes are dangerous




. Deefakes are exponential tools for propaganda


I believe deep fakes will rip the fabric of society.

I know that many things were described as dangerous to this ephemeral fabric, but society *IS* interactions between people and if members cannot trust any communication the outlook doesn't look good. 

We're doomed.
