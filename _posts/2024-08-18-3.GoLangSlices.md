I'm learning [Go](https://go.dev/) (not [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))) and this article shows a number of possible gotchas around the core data type in Go, the slice. Nothing in this article is advanced or profound and every scenario shown here is trivial. 

### Problem

From the beginning of my learning journey I couldn't reconcile two thoughts:
1. Go is built for concurrency 
2. Slices are **independent** views of a contiguous area of memory. When the underlying array needs to be moved (e.g. because it's resized into an another spot) then how does this affect multiple slices?

### Summary 

In summary, I realised that I was expecting Go to protect me from myself like Rust does. Go is different, you're more free. Go let's you shoot yourself in the foot. 

# Main

Slices are fundamental in Go and yet they are not complicated. In fact, their simplicity is what creates the handful of situations where the result may be a surprise. 

_The Go Blog_'s [Go Slices: usage and internals](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro) is a great way to learn about slices. *(Firefox says it's a 10-12 minutes read)* 

I divided the issues into two categories:

1. Not letting go 
2. Working with multiple slices explicitly

Both of the behaviors are obvious once you're aware of them, but they're easy to miss when your start. 

## 1. Not letting go

In *Don't let me go* Cigarettes After Sex sing:

> When I was young I thought the world of you<BR>
> You were all that I wanted then<BR>
> It faded and I never saw you again<BR>
> But I won't forget the love we had<BR>
>
> Come to me now<BR>
> Don't let me go<BR>
> Stay by my side<BR>


Slices can be like this. When you work with some data and then you stop working with it you may assume GC will collect it because you're no longer looking at it, but in fact the GC can be prevented from cleaning it up because a slice exists that could theoretically access the data. 

This behavior affects the following operations:
1. Returned slices
2. Ranges
3. In go <=1.21 functions in the slices package, e.g `Delete`, `Replace` 

If the slice contains pointers this issue affects memory (not being cleaned up) and behavior (the elements past len() contain non-zero-value data). For non-pointer types it's mainly about non-zero values left unchanged. 

A great example of this problem from _The Go Blog_'s [Go Slices: usage and internals](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro)

> ### A possible “gotcha”
> 
> As mentioned earlier, re-slicing a slice doesn’t make a copy of the underlying array. The full array will be kept in memory until it is no longer referenced. Occasionally this can cause the program to hold all the data in memory when only a small piece of it is needed.
> 
> For example, this FindDigits function loads a file into memory and searches it for the first group of consecutive numeric digits, returning them as a new slice.
>
> ```
> var digitRegexp = regexp.MustCompile("[0-9]+")
> 
> func FindDigits(filename string) []byte {
>    b, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
>    return digitRegexp.Find(b)
> }
> ```
>
>This code behaves as advertised, but the returned []byte points into an array containing the entire file. Since the slice references the original array, as long as the slice is kept around the garbage collector can’t release the array; the few useful bytes of the file keep the entire **contents** in memory.

>To fix this problem one can copy the interesting data to a new slice before returning it (...)


### Go 1.22

In go 1.22 the behaviour changes. 

From [Go 1.22 Release Notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.22)

> Functions that shrink the size of a slice (`Delete`, `DeleteFunc`, `Compact`, `CompactFunc`, and `Replace`) now zero the elements between the new length and the old length.
>

The commint is [slices: zero the slice elements discarded by Delete, DeleteFunc, Comp…](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/e21dc702d54e85381a97259db7deec710108279b) and an example change is from
```
func Delete[S ~[]E, E any](s S, i, j int) S {
	_ = s[i:j] // bounds check

	return append(s[:i], s[j:]...)
}
```
to
```
func Delete[S ~[]E, E any](s S, i, j int) S {
	_ = s[i:j] // bounds check

	oldlen := len(s)
	s = append(s[:i], s[j:]...)
	clear(s[len(s):oldlen]) // zero/nil out the obsolete elements, for GC
	return s
}
```

## Solutions

1. Copy and return only the data that is relevant. 
   * See [A possible “gotcha”](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro#a-possible-gotcha).
2. Use `slices.Delete` to delete elements and upgrade to 1.22. 
   * See [Go 1.22 Release Notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.22)
   * See [slices: zero the slice elements discarded by Delete, DeleteFunc, Comp…](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/e21dc702d54e85381a97259db7deec710108279b) 
3. Zero no longer needed elements with `clear()` or `= nil` for elements. 
   * See below

### Zero no longer needed elements

If you're removing elements yourself (i.e. not with using `slices.Delete` then you have to remember to let go of elements explicitly.

For example in [container/heap](https://pkg.go.dev/container/heap)'s priority queue example we can see:

> ```
> func (pq *PriorityQueue) Pop() any {
> 	old := *pq
> 	n := len(old)
> 	item := old[n-1]
> 	old[n-1] = nil  // don't stop the GC from reclaiming the item eventually
> ```

BTW. `= nil` was added in 2024, 12 years after the first commit :)


## 2. Working with multiple slices explicitly 


The *1. Not letting go* section describes scenarios where multiple slices can be involved, but they are transitory: while technically there are multiple slice objects involved, conceptually there is a single view of the data at any time (the slices involved are part of a single lifecycle). 

In this section I describe situations where there are multiple slices looking at the same data on purpose. 

Let's start with a simle slice 

```
s1 := make([]int, 0)
print("s1", &s1)
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
  s1 = append(s1, i)
  print("s1", &s1)
}
```
For brevity, I will omit the print statements from now, unless it's important to show where they are.

<blink>TODO add link to code </blink>

The output: 

```
s1=[] len=0, cap=0
s1=[0] len=1, cap=1, 0xc0000a4018
s1=[0 1] len=2, cap=2, 0xc0000a4040
s1=[0 1 2] len=3, cap=4, 0xc0000ae020
s1=[0 1 2 3] len=4, cap=4, 0xc0000ae020
s1=[0 1 2 3 4] len=5, cap=8, 0xc0000b8040
```

_BTW. The capacity grows using *2 schema (1,2,4,8) to save allocations. Even with this toy code we can see O(1) "amortized" insert time in action._

## Clip 

2. if You clip and there are other slices attached to the array then it won't be removed.
