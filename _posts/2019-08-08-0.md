A new blog about the future? In 2019? By who?

[Life 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0) has been written. [There’s No Fire Alarm for Artificial General Intelligence](https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/) is almost 2 years old. [Singularity Weblog](https://www.singularityweblog.com) will soon be able to celebrate its 10th anniversary. Some of the best Sci-Fi books were written decades years ago.

Let’s face it: This project seems to be 10, maybe 20 years too late. And a good few IQ points too low.

### Why then?

Is there, at least until the next big change arrives, anything significant left to say about machine intelligence, robots, space travel, or the future of humans that hasn’t already written, that hasn’t already been thought? 

As for the issues that seem not to have simple answers is there a point in discussing them more?

I don’t know the answers to these questions, but I know that:
 * the public discourse belongs to all of us: silence is approval; and
 * we should be talking about this; talking makes a difference; and
 * it's fascinating.

Also, according to [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism), which makes a lot of sense, I never had a choice. 

### The end 

Let’s end this bad introduction with the following thought. 

The future is not known but it is made of us. Not in a some meta sense. The future **is** the particles we physically consist of, our actions, words, thoughts, and ideas. 

I hope that thoughts expressed here will be the [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good) part of the future, at least in some sense of this intangible concept.

Thank you for stopping by. I am humbled by your visit.
